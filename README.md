# Bubble Sort Implementation in Ruby

## Brief Project Description
This is a simple implementation of an optimized bubble sort.

Input: array of numbers

Output: sorted array of numbers (destructive mutation)

## Examples: 

```
array = [4, 3, 78, 2, 0, 2]
bubble_sort(array) # => [0, 2, 2, 3, 4, 78]
```

```
array = [1, 3, 7, 22, -2, -5, 4, 101, 3, 4, 7, 6, 5, 1000, 953]
bubble_sort(array) # => [-5, -2, 1, 3, 3, 4, 4, 5, 6, 7, 7, 22, 101, 953, 1000]
```

## What I Learned / Project Goals
The goal of this project was to practice using basic Ruby syntax. Because Bubble Sort is a well-known algorithm, the focus was not on problem-solving. Rather, the point was to implement a pseudocode description of Bubble Sort (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bubble_sort#:~:text=swapped%0Aend%20procedure-,Optimizing%20bubble%20sort,-%5Bedit%5D) using Ruby syntax. This was also a nice introduction to sorting algorithms.
